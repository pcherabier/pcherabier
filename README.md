Hi! My name is Philippe, and I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Ecology and Evolution at the Institut de Biologie de l'École 
Normale Supérieure (IBENS), as well as an engineer in the french Corps des ponts, des eaux et des forêts. 

My doctoral work focuses on microbial adaptation to climate change in the ocean, with a particular focus on heterotrophic 
bacteria and viruses. I do so by developing and analysing mathematical models of ecosystem, applying evolutionary game theory 
and adaptive dynamics to infer potential changes in ecosystem-wide behavior. 

If you'd like to know more, please do check out my blog A Spoonful of Ocean on my personal page, 
where I try to explain as simply as possible what I'm working on.
